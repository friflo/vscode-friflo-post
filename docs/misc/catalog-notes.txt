Short description:
HTTP Client as a VSCode extension to POST JSON, XML, image, ... files to REST APIs and storing response content and headers as files in the VSCode workspace

Description:
Main goal of this VSCode extension is storing all HTTP request & response data automatically as files in a VSCode workspace.
This ensures this data is still available in new VSCode sessions. It also enables other VSCode extensions utilizing request & response files.
E.g. JSON Schema validation of JSON files, storing results in git and comparing subsequent response results with previous ones.
